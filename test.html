                <strong>Grid and flexbox. </strong> The basic difference between CSS Grid Layout and CSS Flexbox Layout is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column. Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout -
                rows, and columns at the same time.

                <strong>The CSS Box Model</strong> it's all about design and layout. In order to set the width and height of an element correctly in all browsers, you need to know how the box model works. The box model allows us to add a border around
                elements, and to define space between elements. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. Explanation of the different

                <strong>Semantic HTML elements are those that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way</strong>The HTML semantics tags provide meaning to an HTML page rather than just presentation or non-semantic
                A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. Elements such as header, footer, and article are all considered semantic because they accurately describe the purpose of the element and
                the type of content that is inside them. Examples of non-semantic elements: div, and span, - Tells nothing about its content. Examples of semantic elements: form, table, and article - Clearly defines its content.
